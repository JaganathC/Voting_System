PROBLEM EXPLANATION:

The existing manual Voting system consumes more time for Vote Casting. Voter has to wait for vote polling station to vote for a right candidate. The election officers has to be check the voter, this voter can vote in this booth then check voter ID present in voters list of booth those are information will be present then the voter can vote in that booth. The voter had to stand in the queue to cast his vote. All the work is done in paper ballot so it is very hard to locate a particular candidates, some voters cast their votes for all candidates. To overcome of all these problems we have to implement a web application, which is helpful for Voting from anywhere.

Methodology:

The objective of the system is a replacement of the traditional system that is in existence. This smart system reduces the time for voting and also the system is reliable, and faster. Itâ€™s meant to be a easy to understand application which can be used by anyone who has a basic understanding of the voting process. Database maintained by this system usually contains the Candidate information, the number of votes(voting statistics), the final Result of total votes.
